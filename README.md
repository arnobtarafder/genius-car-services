# Genius Car Services
This is a demo website and hope it can be a full professional site. 
This is the newer version of **Genesis Automobiles**.  
You can truly use this site by login/signIn or registration/signUp and with the help of advanced local storage, you can store your current profile stage data. Maybe the color combinations in this site are not much good because I have tried to make the site with bootstrap primary edition.
This is not fulfilled to post now.
